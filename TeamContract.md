## **Communication**
   Team Meetings 
      When and how often often will your team meet?
           We plan to meet weekly (dates are yet to be decided but most likely over weekend after communicating each member's availability through a shared group chat).
      How long should each meeting last? 
           Each meeting will be an hour long but can extend longer as needed for members to share progress updates and determine what progress we need to make to further finish our project.
      What software or tool will you use to host these meetings? 
           Meetings will be in person since we all live at ISR and are available for a long time.
      Will someone take notes (record minutes)?
           Members will rotate who will take meeting minutes and can request someone else to cover if needed.

## **Assistance**
      How will your teammates be able to contact you if they need your help or opinion on a task? 
           Teammates can contact each other through a shared message group chat or even through personal message since we all have each other's phone numbers.
      How quickly should you be expected to respond?
           The expectation is that everyone should respond within an hour or two or be able to provide a reasonable explanation as to why they were unavailable.

## **Respect**
      An effective team needs to have an environment which encourages open expression of ideas. How will you ensure that every member has an opportunity to speak and, more importantly, that every member will actively listen and engage with the thoughts of others?
           We all will be given a set amount of period during each meeting to express our opinion regarding the progression of the project and our vision for its completion and what steps are necessary to reach that.
           If any members feel that they are given an unequal say within the project, they can contact the assigned TA with complaints and inform the rest of the team so that we cna take steps to fix any issues.

## **Collaboration**
   Work Distribution 
      How will you assign workload for this project? How will you address unexpected complications or unforeseen work? You are encouraged to identify the strengths and desires of each team member when distributing work. You do not need to all work equally on a particular deliverable â€“ it is the overall work that should be largely equal.
           Members can volunteer to take on tasks that they feel are more suited to their skillset and abilities. 
           Each member is expected to have atleast one working task per week and is encouraged to do more if their time permits.
           If any member has unexpected work during a week and is unable to finish the task they took on, they are expected to inform the group as soon as they are aware of their lack of time and are expected to finish it in tandem with other tasks in the following week.
  Time Commitment 
      How many hours of work per week is expected of each group member? Are there prior time commitments that need to be accounted for? How will you address new conflicts or commitments when they do inevitably occur?
           Members are expected to spend somewhere from 3-4 hours per week. 
           We are all part of multiple RSO's that we are heavily engaged in and are part of the same CS 222 project group so it is inevitable that we will have other time commitments.
           If any member has unexpected work during a week and is unable to finish the task they took on, they are expected to inform the group as soon as they are aware of their lack of time and are expected to finish it in tandem with other tasks in the following week.
           If time becomes a recurring issue for any member in the group, first the rest of the group will inform the TA, then if it continues to be an issue, the TA will be informed about the problem.
           
## **Conflict Resolution**
          The group will follow a 3 strike approach to issues. If the group majority agrees that there is a problem with the third member, the third member will be informed and will be given 3 attempts to correct their behavior.
          If the group member continues to be unable to resolve their problem, after 3 different warnings, the TA will be informed regarding the issue and hopefully some resolution can be reached through there.
          If there is any fundamental disagreements regarding the project, members will attempt to talk it out respectfully in front of the third group member or course staff as a moderator and will only inform course staff officially if the problem becomes severe.
