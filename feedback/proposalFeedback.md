### Comments
One major flaw in Leading Question, with two minor flaws in Algorithms and Datasets.

**Leading Question**
The leading question does not specify which datasets and algorithms would be used to achieve the goal. 

**Dataset**
The dataset is not well specified (what is "second dataset"?). You have also not specified the distance metric/algorithm between any two coordinate points. 

**Algorithm**
The algorithms are well described, although the complexity for Dijkstra mentioned in the proposal is achieved with Fibonacci heap. You should analyze what complexity you would reasonably achieve.
