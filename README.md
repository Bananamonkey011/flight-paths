## Github Organization
***Code*** 
1. All of our code is in the folder called src. <br>
2. In the src folder, we have our container for the airports and their neighbors in the Node class <br>
3. In the src folder, we have our graph created in the Graph class. The graph is created in the constructor once the main is running. <br>
4. All our algorithms for traversals are in our Graph class. The BFS and Dijkstra traversals are functions named after their namesakes. The iterative deepening DFS is a function called IDDFS and has a helper function for each iteration. <br>

***Data***
1. All of our data for the main method is in the folder called src. <br>
2. Our data for the airport nodes is in the file called airports.dat <br>
3. Our data for the edges for the airports is in the file called routes.dat <br>
4. All the airports data is stored in the Node class in the constructor. All the routes data is stored in the Graph class in the constructor. <br>

***Tests***
1. All of our test cases are in the folder called tests <br>
2.
