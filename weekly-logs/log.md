## Week of 03/27 - 04/03
### Goals: 
Our goals for this week was to create a node class that would hold the relevant data for each airport. We also wanted to get started witha the data procssing so that we could read in the data from the airport.dat dataset in a useable manner (into Nodes).

### Progress:

**Nihal:** Created a rudimentary Node Class to hold airport data.

**Manan:** Started looking into Dijkstra's Algorithm and Iterative Deepening to better understand how they work.

**Arul:** Looked into how to access csv files using C++.

### Problems: 
We were all very busy this week due to midterms so ost of our time was spent researching rather than coding.

### Next Weeks Plans:
We hope to finish the Node class and start working on a way to link the Nodes together. We also hope to be done with a method to read data in form a CSV file.


## Week of 04/03 - 04/10

### Goals: 
Our goals for this week was to create our Graph Class that would store all our nodes by reading from the airport.dat file. We also looked into how we would create our traversals using the created Node and Graph Classes.

### Progress:

**Nihal:** This week, I unfortunately was hit with COVID-19, and I had to spend the majority of the week recovering and tending to my own health. However, I was still able to make some progress on the Dijstra algorithm and gained a stronger conceptual understanding of what this algorithm requires from us. I started coding it, but I was not yet able to produce enough to push to the GitHub. My hope is to finish up the algorithm by next Sunday, April 17th.

**Manan:** Finished the Node class to include complete set of data we deemed relevant. Also included a map of Nodes to distances to keep track of connected airports and the distance of route.

**Arul:** Created Graph Class and added file reading functionality to read from airports.dat.

### Problems: 
Unfortunatly, the majority of our group was hit with midterms this week, and with Nihal in quarantine housing for the entire week due to COVID, most of our time had to be spent researching instead of coding.
### Next Weeks Plans:
We hope to add in functionality to create edges into our Graph class and to try to implement a simple BFS on our created graphs.
