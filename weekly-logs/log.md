## Week of 03/27 - 04/03
### Goals: 
Our goals for this week was to create a node class that would hold the relevant data for each airport. We also wanted to get started witha the data procssing so that we could read in the data from the airport.dat dataset in a useable manner (into Nodes).

### Progress:

**Nihal:** Created a rudimentary Node Class to hold airport data.

**Manan:** Started looking into Dijkstra's Algorithm and Iterative Deepening to better understand how they work.

**Arul:** Looked into how to access csv files using C++.

### Problems: 
We were all very busy this week due to midterms so ost of our time was spent researching rather than coding.

### Next Weeks Plans:
We hope to finish the Node class and start working on a way to link the Nodes together. We also hope to be done with a method to read data in form a CSV file.
